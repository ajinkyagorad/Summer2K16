# Neuromorphic Engineering _Spiking Neural Network Simulation_

* Leaky Integrate and Fire Model
* ![Runge-Kutta Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungeâ€“Kutta_methods) for solving differential equation using 4th order
* Izhikevich Model
* Hodgekin Huxley Model
* Implementing a single Neuron based on above model
* Things to do 
*-[ ] Apply neural learning rule," two neurons fire together wire together"

##Results
Simulating different neuron models at different current levels
